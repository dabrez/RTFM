# CruzHacks-RTFM

AI-powered Discord Chat Memory Bot that tracks and embeds all server messages into a Chroma vector database using HuggingFace sentence embeddings. When prompted (e.g., “Is John going to attend the meeting today?”), it performs a similarity search to retrieve contextually relevant chat messages and generates a response using Google Gemini. Designed to help communities quickly find lost information in long chat histories, even if the topic was discussed days ago.
