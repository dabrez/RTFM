# Architecture Task - Quick Reference

## ✅ Task Complete

**Task:** Design system architecture  
**Time Estimate:** 2 hours  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 📦 Deliverables

### ✅ 1. Architecture Diagram
**Location:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` (sections with ASCII diagrams)

**Shows:**
- ✓ Discord Bot (listener + responder)
- ✓ Query Service (Kafka consumer + DB queries)  
- ✓ Response Generator (Gemini integration)
- ✓ Current (simple) vs Future (microservices)
- ✓ All service connections
- ✓ Data stores (PostgreSQL, Redis, ChromaDB)

### ✅ 2. Data Flow Documentation
**Location:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` (Data Flow section)

**Includes:**
- ✓ Message Storage Flow (Current)
- ✓ Query & Response Flow (Current)
- ✓ Message Ingestion Pipeline (Future)
- ✓ Query Processing Pipeline (Future)
- ✓ Step-by-step with data structures

### ✅ 3. Service Boundaries
**Location:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` (Service Boundaries section)

**Defines:**
- ✓ Service 1: Discord Bot (Input/Output contracts)
- ✓ Service 2: Embedding Worker (Kafka consumer)
- ✓ Service 3: Indexing Worker (DB writer)
- ✓ Service 4: Query Service (Search + cache)
- ✓ Service 5: Response Generator (Gemini integration)
- ✓ Database boundaries (PostgreSQL, Redis, ChromaDB)

## 🎯 Key Services (As Required)

### Discord Bot (Listener + Responder)
```
Responsibilities:
• Listen to Discord messages
• Detect trigger phrases ("RTFM")
• Publish to Kafka (future)
• Send responses back to Discord

Boundaries:
Input:  Discord API (messages)
Output: Discord API (responses)
        Kafka (discord_messages, discord_queries)
```

### Query Service (Kafka Consumer + DB Queries)
```
Responsibilities:
• Consume queries from Kafka
• Check Redis cache
• Query ChromaDB for similar messages
• Get guild configs from PostgreSQL
• Publish context to next service

Boundaries:
Input:  Kafka (discord_queries)
Output: Kafka (discord_contexts)
Read:   ChromaDB, Redis, PostgreSQL
```

### Response Generator (Gemini Integration)
```
Responsibilities:
• Consume context from Kafka
• Format prompt for Gemini
• Call Google Gemini API
• Cache responses in Redis
• Publish response to Kafka

Boundaries:
Input:  Kafka (discord_contexts)
Output: Kafka (discord_responses)
External: Google Gemini API
Cache:  Redis
```

## 📊 Quick Architecture Overview

**Current (MVP):**
```
Discord → Bot Container → ChromaDB + Gemini → Discord
         (Everything in one place)
```

**Future (Scalable):**
```
Discord → Bot → Kafka → Workers → Databases → Generators → Bot → Discord
         (Each service independent and scalable)
```

## 📁 File Locations

**Main Document:**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete architecture documentation

**Related Files:**
- `FUTURE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Detailed folder structure
- `README.md` - Project overview with architecture summary
- `FILES_SUMMARY.txt` - Quick reference guide

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **For Implementation:**
   - Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` sections for your service
   - Follow data flow diagrams
   - Use service contracts as API definitions

2. **For Team Planning:**
   - Share with team members
   - Each dev focuses on their service boundary
   - Use diagrams in presentations

3. **For Documentation:**
   - Reference in README
   - Include in project wiki
   - Use for onboarding new developers

## 📝 Quick Facts

**Services Defined:** 5 (Bot, Embedding Worker, Indexing Worker, Query Service, Response Generator)  
**Data Stores:** 3 (PostgreSQL, Redis, ChromaDB)  
**Message Queues:** 4 Kafka topics  
**External APIs:** 2 (Discord, Google Gemini)  

**Scalability:** Each worker can run 3-5 instances independently  
**Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana layer included  
**Security:** Service isolation, no shared state

## ✨ What This Enables

✅ **Clear Development Path**
- Each developer knows their boundaries
- Services can be built in parallel
- Easy to test independently

✅ **Scalability**
- Horizontal scaling of workers
- Kafka buffers load spikes
- Caching reduces API costs

✅ **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to debug issues
- Simple to add new features
